Zenroom and zencode are part of the [DECODE project](https://decodeproject.eu) about data-ownership and [technological sovereignty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvBRbwBm_nQ). Our effort is that of improving people's awareness of how their data is processed by algorithms, as well facilitate the work of developers to create along [privacy by design principles](https://decodeproject.eu/publications/privacy-design-strategies-decode-architecture) using algorithms that can be deployed in any situation without any change.

## 🎮 Quick start

In many use-cases you want to chain execution of different zencode and
pass the output as keys/data to other zencodes.
This small library helps to achieve that by putting your zencode in an
array of steps.

in the following example we define two steps and the result of the first
is passed as `keys` to the second one.

```js
import { execute } from '@dyne/zencode-chain';

const newAccount = `{"username": "Alice"}`;

const steps_definition = {
  verbosity: false,
  steps: [
    {
      id: 'step1',
      zencode: `Scenario ecdh: create the keypair at user creation
Given that my name is in a 'string' named 'username'
When I create the keypair
Then print my 'keypair'`,
      data: newAccount,
    },
    {
      id: 'step2',
      zencode: `Scenario 'ecdh': Publish the public key
Given that my name is in a 'string' named 'username'
and I have my 'keypair'
Then print my 'public key' from 'keypair'`,
      data: newAccount,
      keysFromStep: 'step1',
    },
  ],
};

execute(steps).then((r) => console.log(r));
```

### Step definitions

The steps definition is an object literal defined as follows:

```typescript
type Steps = {
  readonly steps: readonly Step[]; // an array of step definitions
  readonly conf?: string; // zenroom configuration, could be overridden by each step
  readonly verbose?: boolean;
};
```

The single step definition is an object literal defined as follows:

```typescript
type Step = {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly zencode: string;
  readonly data?: string;
  readonly dataFromStep?: string;
  readonly dataTransform?:
    | ((data: string) => string)
    | ((data: string) => Promise<string>);
  readonly keys?: string;
  readonly keysFromStep?: string;
  readonly keysTransform?:
    | ((data: string) => string)
    | ((data: string) => Promise<string>);
  readonly conf?: string;
};
```

The list of the attributes are:

- **id** mandatory, a unique string to identify your step
- **zencode** mandatory, your zencode to run
- **data** optional, the data; when you want to pass it directly
- **dataFromStep** optional, the step.id to get the result as input
- **dataTransform** optional, a function that accepts a string and return a string,
  that will be executed on data just before the execution. This intended to be used
  to mangle your data with some transformation (eg. remove a key, or rename it)
- **keys** optional, the keys; when you want to pass it directly
- **keysFromStep** optional, the step.id to get the result as input
- **keysTransform** optional, a function that accepts a string and return a string,
  that will be executed on keys just before the execution. This intended to be used
  to mangle your keys with some transformation (eg. remove an attribute, or rename it)
- **conf** optional, the zenroom conf for the specific zencode_exec (eg. 'memmanager=lw')
  overrides generic one
